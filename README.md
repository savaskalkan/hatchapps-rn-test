 I tried to do what you want to me. But I didn't use redux because it is not necessary.
 You can test search box and open time.
 Closing times is null, so I accepted the closing hours at 00:00(midnight).
 You can change open times and test it.
 If you have a questions please let me know.
 
 Thank you. See you (:
